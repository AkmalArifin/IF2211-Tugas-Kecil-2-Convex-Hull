## About

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      This little project is one of the task that given in IF2211 Algorithm Strategies. The task is we have to built library about how to solve Convex Hull using Divide and Conquer Algorithm. In this project, I personally used Python. So feel free to use and share, and also I open for any critics and suggestion, especially for my code. Thanks !!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For running this program, you need to install numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn
```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib sklearn
```

### Usage

#### Install myConvexHull Library

You can install myConvexHull library by write this code on command prompt

```sh
pip install src\lib\dist\myConvexHull-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

After install the library you can use the function by using 

```sh
from myConvexHull.myfunctions import myConvexHull
```

Just use the function of ```MyConvexHull``` with params 2d list of two integers (x, y)

#### Run Data Visualization

For running the program to show some data visualization examples you can run between dataVisualizationIris.py, dataVisualizationWine.py, or dataVisualizationBreastCancer.py

For Example:

```sh
py src\dataVisualizationIris.py
```
